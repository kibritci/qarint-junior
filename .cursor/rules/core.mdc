# Qarint Games - Core Development Rules

## Design System
- Use `rounded-2xl` for cards and containers
- Use `shadow-card` / `shadow-card-hover` for elevation
- Use `font-display` (Nunito) for headings, `font-body` (Inter) for body text
- Primary color: `#E11D48` (pinkish-red)
- Backgrounds: white and very light gray (`gray-50`)
- All vectors via OpenMoji CDN: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/hfg-gmuend/openmoji/color/svg/{HEX}.svg`
- UI icons: Heroicons (`@heroicons/react`)

## Cultural Safety (STRICT)
- ALL content must be safe and age-appropriate for children (ages 4-12)
- NEVER generate content involving: alcohol, gambling, violence, dating, inappropriate themes
- Approved themes: family, respect, honesty, kindness, sharing, nature, school
- Dummy data examples: "I help my mother", "We share our food", "I respect my elders"

## Productive Failure
- NEVER deduct points for wrong answers
- Use `animate-funny-shake` CSS animation on wrong answers
- Make failing fun with slapstick humor to encourage retries

## Audio
- Use `window.speechSynthesis` (Web Speech API) for reading words aloud
- Language: `en-US`, rate: `0.8`

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript strict mode
- Zustand for client state, Server Actions for DB writes
- Supabase for database with RLS policies
- Tailwind CSS for styling, canvas-confetti for celebrations
